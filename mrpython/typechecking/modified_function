In typechecker.py following functions were modified:
   --> TypingContext
       ---> the following attributes were added: modifiable_vars, encountered_argument, is_modifiable
            ----> modifiable_vars : flag each var to 
                  -----> 0 if it cannot be modified NOR copied
                  -----> 1 if it cannot be modified BUT can be copied
                  -----> 2 if it can be modified AND copied
            ----> encountered_argument : tells if an argument was encountered when exploring subranches; useful for authorizing list concatenation (see EAdd)
            ----> is_modifiable: bring to the top level the information that the variable can or cannot be modified, making an expression valid or not
       ---> the method register_parameters was modified: parameters were flagged in the modifiable_vars map to 1

   --> type_check_Assign
       ---> mono var case
       ---> multi assignation: needs to be done
   --> type_infer_EAdd: to authorize list concatenation
   --> type_infer_ECall
   --> type_infer_Slicing
